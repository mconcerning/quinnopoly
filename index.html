<p>Quinnopoly! is a two – five player <b>board game</b> designed to be enjoyed by trillions around the globe. The average game time is between 2 and 10 minutes. Inspired by both Monopoly and The Game of Life, Quinnopoly! isn’t a standard game about a race to retirement or a race to… get a monopoly. Instead, Quinnopoly! is an original game with never-before-seen mechanics. It is enjoyable for the whole family and is relatable to all cultures with its classic themes of not going broke and dying. Fun stuff!</p>
<p>Quinnopoly! is free to download and play for non-commercial use only. You cannot sell Quinnopoly! standalone. You can feature Quinnopoly! in something else for commercial use e.g. playing the game in a monetised YouTube video, having a copy of Quinnopoly at an establishment for patrons to play. You cannot reproduce any part of the game for commercial sale.</p>
<p>You can print and play Quinnopoly yourself if you desire. Simply download the zip file (above) and print the game board, the money, the rules, and the cards. You will require two additional die and something to use as player pawns.</p>
